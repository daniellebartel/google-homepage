# Google Homepage Project

A recreation of the Google homepage. Part of the Foundations course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

This project demonstrates an understanding of basic HTML and CSS, including flexbox, hover states, and media queries. It also served as an introduction to using Git on the command line.
